Give Me A Key
=============

Simple and strong password generator so you don't have to use the same password for multiple websites, servers or applications.

How to use this thing?
----------------------
So easy, even your mother can use it! Choose a master password and then use this script to generate sub-passwords for different sites. Generated sub-password will be **copied to the Clipboard**.

	$ python givemeakey.py 
	URI: https://www.gmail.com
	User: jim.geovedi@gmail.com
	Master password: [HIDDEN]

	$ python givemeakey.py 
	URI: https://www.paypal.com
	User: jim@geovedi.com
	Master password: [HIDDEN]

	$ python givemeakey.py
	URI: ssh://10.0.0.6
	User: jim
	Master password: [HIDDEN]

Notes: 

* OSX only... please don't wait for Win32 support ;-)
* **Change master password regularly** to increase security.
